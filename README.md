# docker-openmanage

Dell OpenManage running in a self-contained Docker container. This container will run on RedHat, CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu, and probably most other Linuxes.

#Firmware Upgrade
To upgrade you dell's server firmware from Dell Global repository. Simply run.


`docker run --rm -ti --privileged --net="host" kamermans/docker-openmanage dsu`


You are presented with an interactive TUI where you can select what firmware upgrades are available based on what is installed on your dell hardware/server.

Can upgrade all firmware, including but not limited to BIOS, DRAC, RAID controller, NIC.

#Server Administrator: 
This is a subtree-split and fork of the OpenManage container that Dell created. Notably, this image includes SNMP support and out-of-the box support for registration in OpenManage Essentials.
Base Project: https://github.com/jose-delarosa/docker-images/tree/master/openmanage81

The easiest way to get up and running is to download the standalone startup script, `openmanage.sh`
from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamermans/docker-openmanage/master/openmanage.sh

```
# curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamermans/docker-openmanage/master/openmanage.sh > ./openmanage.sh
# chmod +x openmanage.sh
# ./openmanage.sh 

OpenManage Server Administrator in a Docker Container

Usage: ./openmanage.sh <start|stop|restart|status|update> [snmp_community] [snmp_trap_dest]
   snmp_community   The SNMP community string to use (default: public)
   snmp_trap_dest   The SNMP trap destination - this is normally the IP
                     or hostname to the OpenManage Essentials server
                     (default: 192.168.0.1)

Note that OpenManage Server Administrator will still work without
 either arguments, but will not be detected by OpenManage Essentials.
```

From here you can start the container (the image will be downloaded from Docker Hub the first time) as well as
 stop, restart and check the status of it.  You can also download or update the image by running `./openmanage update`

To connect it to OpenManage Essentials, you'll need to pass the `snmp_community` and `snmp_trap_dest` arguments
so OpenManage Server Administrator knows how to connect to it.

Note that this container uses the Docker options `--pivileged` and `--net=host` in order to access your server 
hardware and correctly report the network configuration.

If you are hesitent to download and run a bash script from some random site on the internet, and you can't understand
my bash code, I would urge you to learn bash, then continue :)

If you choose not to learn bash, here's how to run the container without the init script:

    docker run -d -P \
        --name="openmanage" \
        --privileged \
        --net="host" \
        -v /lib/modules/$(uname -r):/lib/modules/$(uname -r) \
        -e "SNMP_COMMUNITY=snmp_community" \
        -e "SNMP_TRAP_DEST=snmp_trap_dest" \
        kamermans/docker-openmanage

And a big thanks to Dell for sharing the original container with the open source community!
